Board - Main software hub
Should have logging capabilities to a 64GB+ microsd card 
Card should be rated to -40F-80F, also have a weather resistant type incase it gets dropped in water
Should have radio communications that do NOT interfere with the Apex communications
This should shut off as power lowers
All sensors should connect to board and report
Reporting should be in intervals, ex every 5s
Altitude (using barometers) with GPS tracking vs our dependants like gas type or solar input type 
Sensors should start shutting off as battery power decreases to avoid board failing
