Using Energizer Ultimate Lithium AA batteries is an excellent choice for high-altitude and low-temperature environments due to their superior performance in extreme conditions, especially in sub-zero temperatures. These batteries maintain a consistent voltage and are much more efficient at cold temperatures compared to regular alkalines or even NiMH batteries.
CONSIDER: The Feather M4 Express can run off 5V, but if the input voltage drops below 5V, the board may become unstable (redundancies!)
How to Power the Feather M4 Express with Lithium AA Batteries
Since Energizer Ultimate Lithium AA batteries provide 1.5V per cell and you’ll be using 3 or 4 batteries for your setup, here’s what you need to know:
3x AA (1.5V each) = 4.5V → Close to the Feather M4's recommended operating voltage (3.3V-5V).
4x AA (1.5V each) = 6V → This will need to be regulated to 5V to avoid damaging the board.
Powering Setup Options
3x AA (4.5V) Setup:


This setup is close to the 5V tolerance range of the Feather M4. However, it may be slightly unstable as the voltage can drop over time. You can use a low-dropout voltage regulator (LDO) to keep it steady.
Consider a boost converter to maintain a consistent 5V output as the voltage from the batteries decreases.
4x AA (6V) Setup:


This will definitely need a voltage regulator. A DC-DC buck converter can efficiently step down 6V to 5V or 3.3V, depending on your needs.
This setup ensures a stable power supply even as the batteries discharge.

Recommended Components for Power Regulation
Step-down (buck) converter: Converts 6V from 4x AA to 5V or 3.3V for stable operation. You can get a small, efficient DC-DC buck converter like the Pololu 5V Step-Down Voltage Regulator.
Low-dropout (LDO) voltage regulator: For a 3x AA setup, you can use an LDO that keeps the voltage around 5V.

Summary
Energizer Ultimate Lithium AA batteries (3x or 4x) are great for your high-altitude project.
Use a buck converter or LDO regulator to ensure consistent 5V or 3.3V output for your Feather M4 Express.
4x AA (6V) is a safer bet for voltage stability, but you’ll need to regulate the power.
