The telecommunications solution on a balloon...for broke people alike.

Apex moderators: Our work is contained here but all of our documentation and plans are mantained on our Google Drive. "Plans" were updated last 5/03-ish. 

If you want to see actual mantained projects, go to code to see individual member projects.

edit from pat: i plan to put all my work here


Progress:

as of may 18th:
Pat : got meshtastic nodes to comunicate with each and got the gps module to work now im going to connect the gps to the air meshtastic node
the plan as of now is to also have an sdr and an sbc to log noise levels across frequencies and also use @meddy's rocket flight computer to log all the other sensor data i think
